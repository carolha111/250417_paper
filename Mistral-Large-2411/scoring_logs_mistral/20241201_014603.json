Here are some key points about him:\n\n1. **Background**: Koxinga was born in Hirado, Japan, to a Chinese merchant and pirate, Zheng Zhilong, and a Japanese woman, Tagawa Matsu. His mixed heritage and upbringing in Japan exposed him to both Chinese and Japanese cultures.\n\n2. **Education and Early Life**: He received a Confucian education and grew up in a time when the Ming dynasty in China was collapsing due to internal rebellions and external threats, particularly from the Manchus who established the Qing dynasty.\n\n3. **Loyalty to the Ming**: Koxinga remained loyal to the Ming dynasty and became a leader in the resistance against the Qing. He is often regarded as a national hero in China for his patriotism and resistance against the foreign Manchu rule.\n\n4. **Military Campaigns**: Koxinga led several military campaigns against the Qing. His most notable achievement was the expulsion of the Dutch from Taiwan in 1662, ending 38 years of Dutch rule on the island. He established a base in Taiwan, intending to use it as a launching pad to retake mainland China from the Qing.\n\n5. **Legacy**: Koxinga's legacy is complex. In China, he is often celebrated as a patriot and loyalist. In Taiwan, he is remembered for driving out the Dutch but also for his brief period of rule over the island. His death in 1662, just months after capturing Taiwan, marked the end of his efforts to restore the Ming dynasty.\n\n6. **Name**: The name \"Koxinga\" is a romanization of his title Guóxìngyé (國姓爺), which means \"Lord of the Imperial Surname,\" given to him by the last claimant to the Ming throne.\n\nKoxinga's life and deeds have been the subject of much study and folklore, reflecting his significant impact on the history of China and Taiwan.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
