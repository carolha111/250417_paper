Here's a simplified breakdown:\n\n1. **Historical Context**: After World War II, the ROC, led by the Kuomintang (KMT), regained control of China. However, a civil war between the KMT and the Communist Party of China (CPC) resumed, leading to the CPC's victory in Mainland China in 1949. The ROC government retreated to Taiwan, and the two sides have been governed separately since then.\n\n2. **Political Status**:\n   - **Mainland China's Stance**: The PRC views Taiwan as a renegade province and maintains that there is only \"one China\" and that Taiwan is a part of it. The PRC refuses to have diplomatic relations with any country that recognizes the ROC.\n   - **Taiwan's Stance**: The status of Taiwan is contentious. Some in Taiwan favor eventual reunification with the mainland, while others advocate for formal independence. The vast majority of Taiwanese people support the status quo, which is de facto independence.\n   - **International Stance**: Most countries, wanting to avoid diplomatic issues with the PRC, do not recognize the ROC diplomatically to avoid provoking the PRC. Instead, many countries have informal relations with Taiwan, including economic and cultural ties.\n\n3. **Economic Ties**: Despite political tensions, economic ties between Mainland China and Taiwan are significant. Trade and investment flow both ways, with Taiwanese businesses investing heavily in Mainland China and vice versa.\n\n4. **Cross-Strait Relations**: The relationship between the two sides has seen periods of tension and détente. During the 1990s and early 2000s, tensions were high, but they eased somewhat under the KMT presidency of Ma Ying-jeou in Taiwan (2008-2016). However, tensions have risen again since the election of Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) as president of Taiwan in 2016, due to her party's more pro-independence stance.\n\n5. **Military Posturing**: The PRC has not ruled out the use of force to achieve reunification. It regularly conducts military exercises near Taiwan, and the Taiwan Strait remains a potential flashpoint. The U.S. provides defensive arms to Taiwan, which is also a source of tension with the PRC.\n\n6. **International Organizations**: Due to the PRC's influence, Taiwan is not allowed to participate in many international organizations under its official name and instead participates under the name \"Chinese Taipei\" in some organizations.\n\nThis is a very complex issue with strong feelings on all sides, and the situation continues to evolve. It's important to stay informed about current events and developments regarding it.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
