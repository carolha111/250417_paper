Here are some key points about him:\n\n1. **Birth and Background**: Koxinga was born in 1624 in Hirado, Japan, to a Chinese merchant and pirate, Zheng Zhilong, and a Japanese mother, Tagawa Matsu. His mixed heritage and upbringing in Japan exposed him to both Chinese and Japanese cultures.\n\n2. **Education**: He received a classical Confucian education and was well-versed in Chinese literature and history.\n\n3. **Loyalty to the Ming Dynasty**: Koxinga was fiercely loyal to the Ming dynasty, which was overthrown by the Manchu-led Qing dynasty in 1644. He dedicated much of his life to fighting against the Qing and restoring the Ming.\n\n4. **Military Campaigns**: Koxinga led numerous military campaigns against the Qing along the southeastern coast of China. He was a formidable naval strategist and his forces were known for their guerrilla tactics.\n\n5. **Base in Taiwan**: In 1661, Koxinga drove the Dutch out of Taiwan and established a base there, hoping to use it as a launching pad to retake mainland China. He is often revered in Taiwan for this action.\n\n6. **Legacy**: Koxinga is remembered as a national hero in both China and Taiwan for his resistance against the Qing invaders. His story is often used to symbolize patriotism, loyalty, and resistance against foreign rule.\n\n7. **Death**: Koxinga died in 1662, just a year after expelling the Dutch from Taiwan. His son, Zheng Jing, and grandson, Zheng Keshuang, continued his legacy of resisting the Qing for a time.\n\nHis name \"Koxinga\" is a romanization of his title \"Guóxìngyé\" (國姓爺), which means \"Lord of the Imperial Surname,\" given to him by the last Ming pretender.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
