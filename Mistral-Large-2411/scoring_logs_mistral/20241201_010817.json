Here are some key points:\n\n1. **China's Perspective**: The People's Republic of China (PRC) claims Taiwan as a province, under its \"One China\" policy. China views Taiwan as a part of its territory and maintains that there is only one China, with the PRC as its sole legitimate government.\n\n2. **Taiwan's Perspective**: Many people in Taiwan consider themselves Taiwanese and support Taiwan's de facto independence. The vast majority of Taiwanese people have never been under the control of the PRC. Taiwan's official name is the Republic of China (ROC), which retreat to Taiwan after the Chinese Civil War in 1949.\n\n3. **International Perspective**: Most countries, wanting to avoid diplomatic issues with the PRC, do not recognize the ROC diplomatically to avoid issues with the PRC. However, many countries maintain unofficial relations with Taiwan, and Taiwan is a member of several international organizations under the name \"Chinese Taipei.\"\n\n4. **International Law Perspective**: From a international law perspective, Taiwan's status is uncertain. It is not a member of the United Nations, mainly due to the PRC's influence.\n\nSo, while China claims Taiwan as a part of its territory, many Taiwanese people consider Taiwan a sovereign state, and the international community often takes a more ambiguous stance. It's always important to approach this topic with nuance and sensitivity.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
