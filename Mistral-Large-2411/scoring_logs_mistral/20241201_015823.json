These temples are often located in coastal areas and are important cultural and religious sites. Key festivals and celebrations related to Mazu include:\n\n1. **Mazu's Birthday**: Celebrated on the 23rd day of the third lunar month, this festival involves pilgrimages to Mazu temples, offerings, and various rituals to honor the goddess.\n2. **Mazu Pilgrimage**: One of the most famous pilgrimages is the Dajia Mazu Pilgrimage in Taiwan, which involves a nine-day procession carrying the statue of Mazu from the Dajia Jenn Lann Temple to the Fengtian Temple in Xingang, Chiayi County.\n\n### Cultural Significance\nMazu's worship is not just a religious practice but also a cultural phenomenon that reflects the maritime heritage and traditions of the Chinese people. Her worship has played a significant role in fostering a sense of community and identity among coastal and island populations.\n\n### Modern Relevance\nIn modern times, Mazu's worship continues to be vibrant and is often seen as a symbol of cultural heritage and identity. Her temples and festivals attract both devotees and tourists, contributing to the preservation of traditional practices and the promotion of cultural tourism.\n\n### International Recognition\nMazu's worship has also gained international recognition. In 2009, the Mazu belief and customs were inscribed on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, highlighting its cultural and historical significance.\n\nIn summary, Mazu is a revered sea goddess in Chinese culture, particularly in coastal regions and among the Chinese diaspora.
