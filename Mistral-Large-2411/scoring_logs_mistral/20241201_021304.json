Here's a simplified breakdown:\n\n### Historical Background\n1. **Civil War**: The relationship stems from the Chinese Civil War, which ended in 1949. The Communist Party of China, led by Mao Zedong, defeated the Nationalist Party (Kuomintang or KMT), led by Chiang Kai-shek. The KMT retreated to Taiwan, where they established the Republic of China (ROC).\n\n2. **One China Policy**: Both the PRC and the ROC claim to be the sole legitimate government of all of China, including Taiwan. The \"One China\" policy is a diplomatic acknowledgment of this claim, though interpretations vary.\n\n### Political Status\n1. **PRC's Claim**: The PRC views Taiwan as a renegade province that must eventually be reunified with the mainland, potentially by force if necessary.\n\n2. **ROC's Claim**: Taiwan, under the ROC, sees itself as a sovereign state, though its official stance has varied over time. Some in Taiwan advocate for formal independence, while others prefer the status quo or eventual reunification under certain conditions.\n\n### International Recognition\n1. **Diplomatic Isolation**: Most countries, including the United States, do not officially recognize the ROC as a sovereign state to avoid diplomatic conflicts with the PRC. Instead, they recognize the PRC as the sole representative of China.\n\n2. **United Nations**: The PRC replaced the ROC in the United Nations in 1971, further isolating Taiwan on the international stage.\n\n### Economic Ties\n1. **Trade and Investment**: Despite political tensions, there are significant economic ties between China and Taiwan. Taiwanese businesses have invested heavily in mainland China, and trade between the two is substantial.\n\n2. **Tourism**: There is also a significant flow of tourists between the two regions, though this has been affected by political tensions and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n### Military Tensions\n1. **PRC's Military Buildup**: The PRC has significantly increased its military capabilities, including those aimed at Taiwan. This includes missile deployments, naval exercises, and air incursions into Taiwan's air defense identification zone (ADIZ).\n\n2. **Taiwan's Defense**: Taiwan has its own military and has been increasing its defense spending and capabilities in response to the PRC's actions. The United States has been a key supplier of military equipment to Taiwan.\n\n### International Involvement\n1. **United States**: The U.S. has a complex relationship with both the PRC and Taiwan. The Taiwan Relations Act (1979) commits the U.S. to providing Taiwan with the means to defend itself, though it does not guarantee military intervention.\n\n2. **Other Countries**: Many countries maintain unofficial relations with Taiwan through trade offices and cultural exchanges, while officially recognizing the PRC.\n\n### Current Situation\n1. **Cross-Strait Relations**: The relationship between the PRC and Taiwan has seen periods of relative calm and heightened tension. The election of Tsai Ing-wen as President of Taiwan in 2016 and her re-election in 2020 have been points of contention, as her Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is seen as more pro-independence.\n\n2. **Global Context**: The situation is further complicated by broader geopolitical dynamics, including the U.S.-China rivalry and regional security concerns.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between China and Taiwan is multifaceted, involving historical claims, political tensions, economic interdependence, and military posturing. It remains a highly sensitive and contentious issue in international relations.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
