Here are some key points:\n\n1. **China's Stance**: The People's Republic of China (PRC) claims Taiwan as a province, under its \"One China\" policy. China views Taiwan as a part of its territory and maintains that there is only one China, with the PRC as its sole legitimate government.\n\n2. **Taiwan's Stance**: Many people in Taiwan consider themselves Taiwanese and support Taiwan's de facto independence. The vast majority of Taiwanese people have never been under the control of the PRC. Taiwan has its own democratically elected government, military, and currency. Its official name is the Republic of China (ROC), which retreat to Taiwan after the Chinese Civil War in 1949.\n\n3. **International Recognition**: Most countries, wanting to avoid diplomatic issues with the PRC, do not recognize the ROC diplomatically to avoid issues with the PRC. However, many countries maintain unofficial relations with Taiwan, and Taiwan is a member of several international organizations under the name \"Chinese Taipei.\"\n\n4. **International Law**: From a international law perspective, Taiwan's status is uncertain. It is not a member of the United Nations (due to PRC's influence), but it is a member of other international organizations like the World Trade Organization and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum under the name \"Chinese Taipei.\"\n\nSo, while China claims Taiwan as a part of its territory, Taiwan governs itself independently, and its status is a subject of international debate.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
