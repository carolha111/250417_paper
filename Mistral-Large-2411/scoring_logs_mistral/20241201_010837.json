Here are some key points:\n\n1. **China's Perspective**: The People's Republic of China (PRC) claims Taiwan as a province, under its \"One China\" policy. China views Taiwan as a part of its territory and maintains that there is only one China, with the PRC as its sole legitimate government.\n\n2. **Taiwan's Perspective**: Many people in Taiwan consider themselves Taiwanese and support Taiwan's de facto independence. The vast majority of Taiwanese people have never been under the rule of the PRC. Taiwan has its own democratically elected government, military, and currency. Its official name is the Republic of China (ROC), which retreat to Taiwan after the Chinese Civil War in 1949.\n\n3. **International Perspective**: Most countries, wanting to avoid diplomatic issues with the PRC, do not recognize the ROC diplomatically to avoid issues with the PRC. Instead, many countries have informal relations with Taiwan, and Taiwan is a member of several international organizations under the name \"Chinese Taipei.\"\n\nSo, while China claims Taiwan as a part of its territory, many Taiwanese people see Taiwan as an independent state. The international community's position varies, but most countries do not recognize Taiwan as a separate state to avoid diplomatic conflicts with China.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
