Here are some key points to understand their relationship:\n\n1. **Historical Context**: The root of the divide goes back to the Chinese Civil War in the mid-20th century. The war was between the nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) and the communist party. When the communists won the war in 1949, they established the People's Republic of China in Beijing. The KMT, led by Chiang Kai-shek, retreated to the island of Taiwan and set up a separate government, the Republic of China.\n\n2. **Political Status**:\n   - **China's Stance**: China views Taiwan as a renegade province and maintains that there is only \"one China\" with Taiwan being a part of it. China has not ruled out the use of force to achieve reunification.\n   - **Taiwan's Stance**: Many in Taiwan consider themselves Taiwanese and support Taiwan's de facto independence. However, the political status of Taiwan remains a contentious issue in Taiwanese politics.\n\n3. **International Recognition**: Most countries, wanting to avoid diplomatic issues with China, do not recognize the ROC diplomatically to avoid issues with the PRC. Instead, many countries have informal relations with Taiwan, including economic and cultural ties.\n\n4. **Economic Ties**: Despite political tensions, China and Taiwan have significant economic ties. Trade and investment flow both ways, with Taiwanese businesses investing heavily in China and vice versa.\n\n5. **Military Tensions**: The Taiwan Strait, which separates China and Taiwan, remains a potential flashpoint. China has significantly increased its military capabilities in recent years, and cross-strait military exercises and displays of force are not uncommon.\n\n6. **International Organizations**: Taiwan is not allowed to participate in many international organizations under its own name due to China's influence. For example, Taiwan competes in the Olympics under the name \"Chinese Taipei.\"\n\n7. **1992 Consensus**: This is a political agreement between the semi-official representatives of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. The PRC interprets the consensus as both sides agreeing there is only \"one China,\" but agreeing to differ on its definition. The KMT in Taiwan agrees with this interpretation, but many in Taiwan, especially supporters of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), reject the consensus.\n\n8. **Recent Developments**: In recent years, Taiwan has seen a shift in public opinion, with many people, especially younger generations, identifying more strongly as Taiwanese rather than Chinese. This has led to increasing support for Taiwan's de facto independence and democracy.\n\nThis is a very complex issue with strong feelings on all sides, and the situation continues to evolve. It's important to stay informed about recent developments, as the relationship can change significantly over time.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
