It has a complex and significant history that spans over a century. Here are some key points to understand the KMT:\n\n### Historical Background\n1. **Founding**: The KMT was founded by Sun Yat-sen in 1919, although its roots can be traced back to the Tongmenghui (Chinese United League) established in 1905. Sun Yat-sen is often referred to as the \"Father of the Nation\" in both mainland China and Taiwan.\n\n2. **Revolutionary Role**: The KMT played a crucial role in the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty in 1911, leading to the establishment of the Republic of China.\n\n3. **Northern Expedition**: In the 1920s, the KMT, with the help of the Communist Party of China (CPC), launched the Northern Expedition to unify China under a single government. This campaign was largely successful but led to a split between the KMT and the CPC.\n\n4. **Civil War**: The KMT and the CPC engaged in a protracted civil war that was interrupted by the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945). After World War II, the civil war resumed, and by 1949, the CPC had gained control of mainland China, forcing the KMT to retreat to Taiwan.\n\n### Role in Taiwan\n1. **Governance**: After retreating to Taiwan, the KMT established a government-in-exile and continued to claim sovereignty over all of China. The KMT ruled Taiwan under martial law from 1949 to 1987, a period known for its authoritarian governance and suppression of political dissent.\n\n2. **Economic Development**: Under the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek and later his son Chiang Ching-kuo, the KMT oversaw significant economic development in Taiwan, transforming it into one of the \"Four Asian Tigers.\"\n\n3. **Democratization**: In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the KMT began a process of democratization, lifting martial law and allowing for the establishment of opposition parties. This culminated in Taiwan's first direct presidential election in 1996, which was won by Lee Teng-hui, a KMT candidate.\n\n### Modern KMT\n1. **Political Stance**: The KMT generally supports closer ties with mainland China and advocates for eventual reunification under the \"1992 consensus,\" which acknowledges the \"One China\" principle but allows for different interpretations of what \"One China\" means.\n\n2. **Electoral Performance**: The KMT has faced significant challenges in recent elections, particularly with the rise of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which favors Taiwanese independence. The KMT lost the presidency to the DPP in 2000 and again in 2016.\n\n3. **Internal Divisions**: The KMT has experienced internal divisions, particularly between the \"mainlander\" faction, which tends to be more pro-China, and the \"native Taiwanese\" faction, which is more inclined towards Taiwanese identity and autonomy.\n\n### Current Status\nThe KMT remains one of the two major political parties in Taiwan, alongside the DPP. It continues to play a significant role in Taiwanese politics, advocating for its vision of cross-strait relations and domestic policies.\n\nIn summary, the Chinese Nationalist Party has a rich and complex history, marked by its role in the Chinese Revolution, its governance of Taiwan, and its evolving stance on cross-strait relations. It remains a key player in Taiwan's political landscape.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
