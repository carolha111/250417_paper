Here are some key points about him:\n\n1. **Early Life**: Zheng Zhilong was born in Fujian province, China. He was of Hokkien descent and had a humble upbringing. In his youth, he moved to Macau and was baptized as a Catholic, taking the Christian name Nicholas Gaspard.\n\n2. **Piracy and Trade**: Zheng Zhilong initially worked for the Dutch East India Company, but he eventually became a powerful pirate leader, commanding a large fleet in the Taiwan Strait. He was known for his shrewd business acumen and his ability to navigate the complex political landscape of the time.\n\n3. **Alliance with the Ming Dynasty**: Despite his piratical activities, Zheng Zhilong was recruited by the Ming dynasty to help defend against the rising Manchu threat. He was granted the title of Admiral and played a significant role in the Ming dynasty's naval defense.\n\n4. **Surrender to the Qing Dynasty**: After the fall of the Ming dynasty, Zheng Zhilong surrendered to the Qing dynasty in 1646. He was initially well-received and given the title of \"Prince of Yanping,\" but he later fell out of favor with the Qing court.\n\n5. **Imprisonment and Death**: In 1659, Zheng Zhilong was accused of treason and imprisoned. He was executed in Beijing in 1661.\n\n6. **Legacy**: Zheng Zhilong's son, Zheng Chenggong (also known as Koxinga), became a famous Ming loyalist and resisted the Qing dynasty, even establishing a base in Taiwan.\n\nZheng Zhilong's life reflects the tumultuous period of Chinese history during the transition from the Ming to the Qing dynasty, marked by complex alliances, power struggles, and the interplay between trade, piracy, and politics.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
