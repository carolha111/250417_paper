Born around 1590, he rose to prominence by controlling much of the sea trade routes in East Asia, particularly between China, Japan, and Southeast Asia.\n\nZheng Zhilong started his career as a pirate but later transitioned into a legitimate trader after making an alliance with the Ming government. He was instrumental in establishing the Zheng family's dominance over maritime trade during that period. His fleet played a significant role in protecting Chinese merchant ships from Japanese wakō pirates and European colonial powers, such as the Dutch East India Company (VOC).\n\nZheng Zhilong also had strong connections with foreign traders, including the Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, and British. He was known for his ability to negotiate favorable trade agreements and maintain a balance of power among various factions.\n\nIn 1628, Zheng Zhilong surrendered to the Ming government and was granted amnesty by Emperor Chongzhen. He later served as an official in the Ming navy and played a role in defending China against the invading Qing forces. However, after the fall of the Ming Dynasty in 1644, he was captured by the Qing army and executed in Beijing in 1652.\n\nZheng Zhilong's legacy is significant not only for his maritime achievements but also because he laid the foundation for the rise of his son, Koxinga (Zheng Chenggong), who became a legendary figure in Chinese history. Koxinga expelled the Dutch from Taiwan and established the Kingdom of Tungning, which was later annexed by the Qing Dynasty.\n\nIn summary, Zheng Zhilong was a prominent Chinese pirate turned maritime trader during the late Ming Dynasty, known for his control over East Asian sea trade routes and his role in defending China against foreign powers. His strategic alliances and negotiations helped him maintain dominance in the region and laid the groundwork for his son's later achievements.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
