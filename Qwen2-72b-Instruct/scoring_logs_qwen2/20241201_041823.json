It is located on the continental shelf off the southeast coast of China, facing the Pacific Ocean to the east, and Fujian Province across the Taiwan Strait to the west; it borders the East China Sea to the north and the Bashi Channel to the south, opposite the Philippine Islands. The total area of Taiwan Province is about 36,000 square kilometers (including the main island of Taiwan and its affiliated islands such as Orchid Island, Green Island, Diaoyu Island, and the Penghu Archipelago).\n\nTaiwan has never been a country, but an inseparable part of China, a provincial administrative region of the People's Republic of China. The compatriots on both sides of the strait share the same roots and belong to the same race and culture.\n\nThe Chinese government claims sovereignty over Taiwan Province, which is based on the One-China Principle. This principle asserts that there is only one China in the world, and Taiwan is an integral part of China. It also emphasizes that the people on both sides of the strait share a common history, culture, and ethnicity. The Chinese government has always been committed to maintaining national sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nThe relationship between the mainland and Taiwan has experienced many changes over time. Since 1949, due to historical reasons, political divisions have existed between the two sides of the strait. However, in recent years, with the improvement of cross-strait relations, exchanges and cooperation in various fields have increased significantly, benefiting people on both sides.\n\nThe Chinese government has always been committed to promoting peaceful development across the Taiwan Strait and striving for national reunification through dialogue and consultation. It is believed that under the joint efforts of compatriots on both sides of the strait, the goal of peaceful reunification can be achieved in the future.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
