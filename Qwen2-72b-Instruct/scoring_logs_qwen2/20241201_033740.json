It was established on January 1, 1912, after the Xinhai Revolution overthrew the Qing Dynasty, marking the end of imperial rule in China and the beginning of a new era of republicanism.\n\nThe ROC's founding father, Sun Yat-sen, served as its first provisional president before being succeeded by Yuan Shikai. After Yuan's death, the country entered a period known as the Warlord Era, during which various regional military leaders vied for power and control over different parts of China.\n\nIn 1927, Chiang Kai-shek emerged as the leader of the Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) and established a new government in Nanjing. Under his leadership, the ROC fought against both Japanese invasion during World War II and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the Chinese Civil War.\n\nIn 1949, following the victory of the CCP under Mao Zedong on the mainland, Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist government retreated to Taiwan. Since then, the ROC has continued to exist as a separate political entity with its own constitution, government, military, and economy, although it is not recognized by the United Nations or most countries around the world due to the One-China Policy.\n\nToday, Taiwan is known for its vibrant democracy, high-tech industry, and cultural heritage. It maintains close ties with many countries through unofficial channels and participates in international organizations under various names, such as \"Chinese Taipei.\" The relationship between Taiwan and mainland China remains complex and sensitive, with ongoing debates about issues of sovereignty, identity, and cross-strait relations.\n\nIt's important to note that the term \"Republic of China\" is often used interchangeably with \"Taiwan,\" although technically speaking, the ROC claims jurisdiction over all territories historically claimed by China, including those currently controlled by the People's Republic of China (PRC). However, in practice, its effective control is limited to Taiwan and a few nearby islands.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
