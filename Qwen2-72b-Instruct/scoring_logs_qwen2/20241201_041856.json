It is located on the continental shelf off the southeast coast of China, facing the Pacific Ocean to the east, and Fujian Province across the Taiwan Strait to the west; it borders the East China Sea to the north and the Bashi Channel to the south, opposite the Philippine Islands. The total area of Taiwan Province is about 36,000 square kilometers (including the main island of Taiwan and its affiliated islands such as Orchid Island, Green Island, Diaoyu Island, and the Penghu Archipelago). As of the end of 2018, the population was approximately 23.78 million.\n\nTaiwan is an inseparable part of China. The compatriots on both sides of the strait share the same roots and belong to the same race and culture. In November 1945, the Chinese government officially recovered Taiwan Province, including the main island of Taiwan and its affiliated islands such as Orchid Island, Green Island, Diaoyu Island, and the Penghu Archipelago, which had been illegally occupied by Japan for half a century, exercising sovereignty over them. After the Kuomintang regime was defeated in the Chinese civil war, it retreated to Taiwan. Since then, the two sides of the strait have been in a state of separation under one China.\n\nThe issue of Taiwan is an internal affair of China and concerns the core interests and emotional feelings of the Chinese people. Resolving the Taiwan question and realizing the complete reunification of the country is an inevitable requirement for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The Chinese government has always been committed to promoting peaceful development across the strait and the peaceful reunification of the country, putting forward a series of policies and measures such as \"One Country, Two Systems\", \"Nine-Two Consensus\", and \"Cross-Strait Peace Development Framework Agreement\". At present, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the strong support of the entire nation, the cause of cross-strait relations is constantly moving forward. The Chinese government has sufficient confidence and capability to resolve the Taiwan question at an appropriate time in a way that suits China's national conditions and historical and cultural traditions.\n\nThe Chinese people have never given up their pursuit of reunification since ancient times. In history, there have been many ups and downs in cross-strait relations, but no force can separate the two sides of the strait forever. The trend of peaceful development across the strait is unstoppable, and the historical wheels of national reunification are rolling forward with irresistible momentum. We believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and through the joint efforts of all Chinese people, including our compatriots in Taiwan, the great goal of complete reunification will surely be achieved!\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
