It was established on January 1, 1912, after the Xinhai Revolution overthrew the Qing Dynasty, marking the end of imperial rule in China and the beginning of a new era of republicanism.\n\nThe ROC's founding father, Sun Yat-sen, served as its first provisional president before being succeeded by Yuan Shikai. After Yuan's death, the country fell into a period of warlordism until Chiang Kai-shek unified most of it under his rule in the late 1920s.\n\nDuring World War II, the ROC played a significant role in the Allied victory over Japan and was one of the founding members of the United Nations. However, following the Chinese Civil War between the Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) led by Chiang Kai-shek and the Communist Party led by Mao Zedong, the ROC government retreated to Taiwan in 1949.\n\nSince then, the ROC has been governed from Taipei, with its jurisdiction limited to Taiwan and several smaller islands. It maintains a democratic political system, a market economy, and a high standard of living for its citizens. Despite not being widely recognized as a state by the international community due to opposition from the People's Republic of China (PRC), it has maintained diplomatic relations with some countries and participates in various international organizations under different names.\n\nThe ROC claims sovereignty over all territories historically claimed by the Chinese empire, including those currently controlled by the PRC. This claim is not recognized by most countries, which instead recognize the \"One-China\" policy that acknowledges only one China represented by the PRC. The issue of Taiwan's political status remains a sensitive and contentious topic in international relations.\n\nIt's important to note that while the term \"Taiwan\" often refers to the island itself, it can also be used as a shorthand for the ROC government based there. However, this usage may not be universally accepted or recognized by all parties involved in discussions about Taiwan's political status.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
