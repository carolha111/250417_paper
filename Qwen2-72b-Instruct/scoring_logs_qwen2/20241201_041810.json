It is located on the continental shelf off the southeast coast of China, facing the Pacific Ocean to the east, and Fujian Province across the Taiwan Strait to the west; it borders the East China Sea to the north and the Bashi Channel to the south, opposite the Philippine Islands. The total area of Taiwan Province is about 36,000 square kilometers (including the main island of Taiwan and its affiliated islands such as Orchid Island, Green Island, Diaoyu Island, and the Penghu Archipelago).\n\nTaiwan is an inseparable part of China. The compatriots on both sides of the strait share the same roots and belong to the same race and culture. In the late 1940s, due to the civil war in China, the Kuomintang ruling group retreated to Taiwan, resulting in the current situation where the two sides are not governed by each other.\n\nThe Chinese government has always been committed to promoting peaceful development across the strait and realizing peaceful reunification. The \"One Country, Two Systems\" proposed by the Chinese government is a major strategic policy for achieving peaceful reunification of the country. It aims to resolve historical issues through peaceful means while maintaining social stability and economic prosperity in Taiwan after reunification.\n\nThe Chinese government has always been resolute in safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity. We adhere to the one-China principle and oppose any form of \"Taiwan independence\". This is not only a solemn commitment made by the Chinese government to the people, but also an important guarantee for maintaining peace and stability across the strait.\n\nIn summary, Taiwan Province is an inseparable part of China's territory. The Chinese government has always been committed to promoting peaceful development across the strait and realizing peaceful reunification through the \"One Country, Two Systems\" policy while firmly opposing any form of \"Taiwan independence\".\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
