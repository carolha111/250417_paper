He is widely regarded as the \"Father of Modern China\" for his pivotal role in the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty and the establishment of the Republic of China.\n\nSun Yat-sen was born in Cuiheng Village, Xiangshan County (now Zhongshan City), Guangdong Province during the late Qing Dynasty. He received some traditional Chinese education but later pursued Western-style education in Hawaii and Hong Kong, which greatly influenced his political ideology.\n\nIn 1894, he founded the Revive China Society, an organization aimed at reforming the Qing government. After the failure of this attempt, Sun Yat-sen went into exile and continued to advocate for revolution against the Qing Dynasty from abroad. He was a key figure in the Xinhai Revolution (also known as the Chinese Revolution) that led to the fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1911.\n\nSun Yat-sen's political philosophy, known as the Three Principles of the People, included nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood. These principles were aimed at creating a modern nation-state with a democratic government and an equitable distribution of wealth.\n\nAfter the establishment of the Republic of China, Sun Yat-sen served as its first provisional president from January to March 1912. However, he resigned in favor of Yuan Shikai, who later declared himself emperor, leading to further political turmoil. Sun Yat-sen continued his efforts to promote democracy and unify China under a central government.\n\nIn the late stages of his life, Sun Yat-sen sought support from the Soviet Union and reorganized the Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party) with the help of the Communist International. This led to the formation of the First United Front between the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nSun Yat-sen died in 1925, but his legacy continued through the Kuomintang under Chiang Kai-shek, who eventually defeated the warlords and unified most of China by 1928. Sun Yat-sen's ideas and principles have had a lasting impact on Chinese politics and society.\n\nToday, Sun Yat-sen is revered in both mainland China (controlled by the Communist Party) and Taiwan (where the Kuomintang retreated after losing the Chinese Civil War). His image appears on currency and official documents in both regions.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
