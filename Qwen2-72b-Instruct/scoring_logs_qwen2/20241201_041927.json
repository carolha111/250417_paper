It is located on the continental shelf off the southeast coast of China, facing the Pacific Ocean to the east, and Fujian Province across the Taiwan Strait to the west; it borders the East China Sea to the north and the Bashi Channel to the south, opposite the Philippine Islands. The total area of Taiwan Province is about 36,000 square kilometers (including the main island of Taiwan and affiliated islands such as Orchid Island, Green Island, Diaoyu Island, and the Penghu Archipelago).\n\nTaiwan is an inseparable part of China. The compatriots on both sides of the strait share the same roots and belong to the same race and culture. In the late 1940s, due to the civil war in China, the Kuomintang ruling group retreated to Taiwan, resulting in the current situation where the two sides are not governed by each other.\n\nThe Chinese government has always been committed to promoting peaceful development across the strait and realizing peaceful reunification. The \"One Country, Two Systems\" proposed by the Chinese government is a major strategic policy for achieving peaceful reunification of the country. It provides that Taiwan can maintain its original social system and lifestyle after reunification, and conduct exchanges with foreign countries in various fields under the name of China.\n\nIn recent years, cross-strait relations have experienced twists and turns. The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities on the island of Taiwan refuse to acknowledge the 1992 Consensus that embodies the one-China principle, support and connive at \"Taiwan independence\" activities, obstruct and sabotage cross-strait exchanges and cooperation, and collude with external forces to provoke and escalate tensions in the Taiwan Strait. These actions have seriously undermined peace across the strait and the interests of compatriots on both sides.\n\nThe Chinese government has always been resolute in safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and will never tolerate any form of \"Taiwan independence\" separatist activities. We are willing to make the greatest efforts for peaceful reunification, but we absolutely reserve the option of taking all necessary measures in response to external interference and provocations by \"Taiwan independence\" forces.\n\nThe Chinese government has always been committed to promoting cross-strait exchanges and cooperation, enhancing mutual understanding and friendship between compatriots on both sides, and jointly promoting the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. We believe that with the joint efforts of compatriots on both sides, the goal of peaceful reunification will surely be achieved.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
