This jade sculpture is a masterpiece of Chinese art from the late Qing Dynasty (1644–1912).\n\nThe Jadeite Cabbage with Insects is made entirely out of a single piece of greenish-white jadeite that has natural brown and pink impurities. The artist ingeniously used these impurities to create the appearance of a cabbage, complete with a leafy stalk and a cluster of insects resting on it. The sculpture measures approximately 18 cm in height and 35.5 cm in width.\n\nThe cabbage is carved with meticulous detail, from its tightly wrapped leaves at the base to the more open ones near the top. The brown impurities were used to create the veins on the leaves, while the pink impurities form a cluster of two grasshoppers and a mantis that appear to be resting or feeding on the cabbage.\n\nThe Jadeite Cabbage with Insects is not only an exquisite piece of art but also carries symbolic meaning in Chinese culture. The cabbage represents purity and integrity, as it sounds similar to the word for \"clean\" in Chinese (清, qīng). The insects are often seen as symbols of abundance and fertility. Together, they convey a message of good fortune, prosperity, and moral virtue.\n\nThe sculpture was originally part of the imperial collection at the Forbidden City in Beijing before being moved to Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War. It has since become one of the most popular attractions at the National Palace Museum, drawing millions of visitors each year who are captivated by its beauty and craftsmanship.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
