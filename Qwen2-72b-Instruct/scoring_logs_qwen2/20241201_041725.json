The term \"Cross-Strait\" comes from the fact that these two entities are separated by the Taiwan Strait, a body of water about 160 kilometers wide at its narrowest point.\n\nHistorically, both Mainland China and Taiwan share a common cultural heritage and history. However, their political relationship has been complex and contentious since the Chinese Civil War in the mid-20th century. In 1949, after the Communist Party of China (CPC) established the People's Republic of China on the mainland, the defeated Nationalist government under Chiang Kai-shek retreated to Taiwan and continued to govern as the Republic of China.\n\nSince then, both governments have claimed legitimacy over \"China,\" leading to a situation where each side views itself as the sole legitimate authority. The political status of Taiwan remains one of the most sensitive issues in international relations, with many countries recognizing only one of the two entities due to their One-China Policy stance.\n\nCross-Strait relations have been marked by periods of tension and conflict, particularly during the Cold War era when both sides engaged in military standoffs and propaganda campaigns against each other. In recent decades, there have been efforts to improve economic ties and people-to-people exchanges, but political tensions persist due to Taiwan's pursuit of greater autonomy and Mainland China's insistence on eventual reunification under its sovereignty.\n\nThe \"1992 Consensus,\" a tacit agreement reached between representatives from both sides in 1992, acknowledges the existence of \"one China\" while allowing each side to interpret what that means. However, this consensus has been controversial and is not universally accepted by all political parties or factions within Taiwan.\n\nIn recent years, Cross-Strait relations have become increasingly strained due to factors such as growing Taiwanese identity, increased international support for Taiwan (especially from the United States), and Mainland China's assertive foreign policy. The issue of Taiwan remains a significant point of contention in global politics, with implications for regional stability and security.\n\nIt is important to note that while I have provided an overview of Cross-Strait relations, this topic is complex and multifaceted, involving historical, political, economic, and social dimensions. Understanding the nuances of these dynamics requires further study and analysis.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
