He served as the leader of the Republic of China both on mainland China before 1949 and later in Taiwan until his death.\n\nChiang Kai-shek rose to prominence within the Kuomintang (KMT), also known as the Chinese Nationalist Party, which was founded by Sun Yat-sen. After Sun's death in 1925, Chiang took control of the KMT and became a key figure in the Northern Expedition, a military campaign aimed at unifying China under KMT rule.\n\nDuring his leadership, Chiang Kai-shek faced numerous challenges, including the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945), which was part of World War II. He led Chinese resistance against Japanese invasion and received support from the United States and other Allied powers during this period.\n\nAfter Japan's defeat in 1945, Chiang Kai-shek's KMT government faced renewed conflict with the Communist Party of China (CPC) led by Mao Zedong. The Chinese Civil War resumed, and despite initial successes, the KMT forces were eventually defeated on mainland China. In 1949, Chiang retreated to Taiwan with his loyalists, where he established a new government.\n\nChiang Kai-shek ruled Taiwan under martial law for several decades, suppressing political opposition and promoting economic development. His regime was characterized by authoritarianism and the promotion of Chinese nationalism. He died in office on April 5, 1975, and was succeeded by his son Chiang Ching-kuo.\n\nChiang Kai-shek's legacy is complex and controversial. In Taiwan, he is remembered as a key figure in the defense against Japanese invasion and for laying the foundations of economic development. However, his authoritarian rule and human rights abuses are also widely criticized. On mainland China, where the CPC has been in power since 1949, Chiang Kai-shek is generally portrayed negatively due to his role in opposing the Communist revolution.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
