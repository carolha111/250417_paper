He is widely regarded as the \"Father of Modern China\" for his pivotal role in the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty and the establishment of the Republic of China.\n\nSun Yat-sen was born in Cuiheng Village, Xiangshan County (now Zhongshan City), Guangdong Province during the late Qing Dynasty. He received some traditional Chinese education but later pursued a medical degree in Hong Kong where he became influenced by Western ideas and began to advocate for political reform in China.\n\nIn 1894, Sun Yat-sen founded the Revive China Society, an organization dedicated to overthrowing the Qing government and establishing a republic. He was involved in several uprisings against the Qing Dynasty but they were all unsuccessful until the Wuchang Uprising of 1911 which led to the Xinhai Revolution and the eventual abdication of the last emperor of China.\n\nAfter the fall of the Qing, Sun Yat-sen became the provisional president of the Republic of China in January 1912. However, he resigned shortly after in favor of Yuan Shikai who later declared himself emperor, leading to a period known as the Warlord Era. Sun continued his political activities and reorganized the Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party) with the help of the Soviet Union.\n\nSun Yat-sen is best known for his political philosophy called the Three Principles of the People: nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood. He also advocated for a gradual transition from military rule to political tutelage and finally to constitutional government.\n\nSun Yat-sen died in 1925 due to gallbladder cancer while planning a national unification campaign against the warlords. His death left a significant void in Chinese politics, leading to a power struggle within the Kuomintang that would eventually result in the rise of Chiang Kai-shek.\n\nSun Yat-sen's legacy is complex and has been interpreted differently by various political factions in China. He is revered as a national hero on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and his portrait appears on Chinese currency. His ideas continue to influence modern Chinese politics, particularly those related to nationalism and unification.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
