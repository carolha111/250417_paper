She is regarded as the goddess of the sea, protector of sailors, fishermen, travelers, and merchants.\n\nMazu's origins can be traced back to a historical figure named Lin默Mo Niang (Silent Girl), who lived during the Song Dynasty in Fujian Province, China. According to legend, she was born on Meizhou Island around 960 AD and possessed supernatural abilities, including the power to calm storms and predict weather changes. She dedicated her life to helping others by rescuing shipwrecked sailors and guiding lost travelers.\n\nAfter Lin Mo Niang's death at a young age, locals reported numerous miraculous events attributed to her spirit, which led to the construction of temples in her honor. The first Mazu temple was built on Meizhou Island around 987 AD. Over time, her cult spread throughout China and beyond, with many more temples being erected along coastal areas.\n\nMazu is often depicted wearing a red robe and a phoenix crown, holding a scepter or a fly-whisk in one hand and accompanied by two loyal generals, Qianliyan (Thousand Mile Eye) and Shunfeng'er (Wind-Ear). These generals are believed to assist her in watching over the seas and protecting people from danger.\n\nThe worship of Mazu has evolved into an important cultural phenomenon, with various rituals, festivals, and ceremonies dedicated to her. The most significant festival is held on her birthday, which falls on the 23rd day of the third lunar month. During this time, devotees gather at temples to offer prayers, incense, and sacrifices in hopes of receiving Mazu's blessings for safety, prosperity, and good fortune.\n\nMazuism, the religious practice centered around the worship of Mazu, has been recognized as an official religion by the Taiwanese government since 2017. It is estimated that there are over 1,500 temples dedicated to Mazu in Taiwan alone, with millions of followers worldwide.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
