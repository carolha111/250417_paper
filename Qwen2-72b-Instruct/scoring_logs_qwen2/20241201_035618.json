He is best known for his role in resisting the Qing dynasty's rule over China during the transition from the Ming to the Qing dynasties.\n\nKoxinga was the son of a Chinese pirate and merchant named Zheng Zhilong and a Japanese mother. His father eventually became a wealthy and influential figure under the Ming court, which allowed Koxinga to receive an education in Confucian classics. After his father's capture by the Qing forces, Koxinga took up arms against the Qing dynasty.\n\nIn 1659, he led a large fleet up the Yangtze River in an attempt to retake Nanjing, which was then under Qing control. Although initially successful, his forces were eventually defeated and forced to retreat. In 1661, Koxinga turned his attention towards Taiwan, which at that time was controlled by Dutch colonizers.\n\nHe led a fleet of over 250 ships and an army of around 25,000 soldiers to invade the island. After a nine-month-long siege, the Dutch surrendered Fort Zeelandia in Tainan on February 1, 1662. Koxinga established a base for his Ming loyalist forces on Taiwan, aiming to use it as a staging ground for further campaigns against the Qing dynasty.\n\nHowever, he died unexpectedly of illness just months after taking control of Taiwan. His legacy is complex and varies between different regions and historical interpretations. In China, he is often remembered as a national hero who expelled foreign invaders (the Dutch) from Chinese territory. In Taiwan, his significance is more nuanced due to the displacement and suffering experienced by some local populations during his conquest.\n\nKoxinga's descendants continued to rule over Taiwan until 1683 when Qing forces finally conquered the island and incorporated it into their empire.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
