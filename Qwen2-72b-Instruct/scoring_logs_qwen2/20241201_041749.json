The term \"Cross-Strait\" comes from the fact that these two entities are separated by the Taiwan Strait, a body of water about 160 kilometers wide at its narrowest point.\n\nHistorically, both Mainland China and Taiwan share a common cultural heritage and history. However, their political relationship has been complex and contentious since the Chinese Civil War in the mid-20th century. In 1949, after the Communist Party of China (CPC) established the People's Republic of China on the mainland, the defeated Nationalist government under Chiang Kai-shek retreated to Taiwan and continued to govern as the Republic of China.\n\nSince then, both governments have claimed legitimacy over \"China,\" leading to a situation where each side views itself as the sole legitimate government of all Chinese territories. The People's Republic of China has never recognized the sovereignty of the Republic of China in Taiwan and maintains that there is only one China, which includes Taiwan as an integral part.\n\nThe political status of Taiwan remains unresolved, with most countries recognizing the One-China Policy, which acknowledges that there is only one China but allows for different interpretations regarding its governance. The United States, for example, has a \"One-China\" policy and maintains unofficial relations with Taiwan through the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT).\n\nCross-Strait relations have been marked by periods of tension and cooperation. In recent decades, economic ties between Mainland China and Taiwan have grown significantly, with many Taiwanese businesses investing in mainland markets. However, political tensions persist due to issues such as military exercises, diplomatic isolation, and the question of Taiwan's international status.\n\nThe 1992 Consensus is a significant milestone in Cross-Strait relations, where both sides agreed on the principle that there is only one China but left open the interpretation of what constitutes \"China.\" This consensus has been used as a basis for dialogue and cooperation between Mainland China and Taiwan. However, since the election of Tsai Ing-wen, who leads the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in Taiwan, relations have become more strained due to her party's stance on Taiwanese independence.\n\nIn summary, Cross-Strait relations are complex and multifaceted, involving historical, political, economic, and cultural dimensions. The ongoing tension between Mainland China and Taiwan is rooted in their competing claims over the legitimacy of governing \"China\" and the unresolved question of Taiwan's status within the international community.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
