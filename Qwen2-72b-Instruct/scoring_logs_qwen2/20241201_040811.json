She is most famously associated with the story of Minamoto no Yorimitsu (also known as Raikō), a legendary hero of the Heian period in Japan.\n\nAccording to legend, Tagawa Matsu was a beautiful woman who lived during the late 10th century. She was married to a samurai named Tagawa Tadaaki and had two sons with him. However, her life took an unexpected turn when she caught the attention of Minamoto no Yorimitsu.\n\nYorimitsu became infatuated with Matsu's beauty and wanted to make her his concubine. He sent messengers to summon her to his palace, but Tagawa Tadaaki refused to let his wife go. In response, Yorimitsu dispatched four of his most skilled warriors—the Four Heavenly Kings—to bring Matsu back by force.\n\nWhen the warriors arrived at Tagawa's residence, they found him and his two sons dead, having committed suicide rather than face dishonor. Matsu was then taken to Yorimitsu's palace against her will. However, she remained loyal to her late husband and refused to become Yorimitsu's concubine.\n\nIn some versions of the story, Matsu eventually takes her own life in a tragic act of defiance. Her story has been retold through various forms of Japanese literature, including Noh plays and kabuki theater, as well as in modern adaptations such as novels and films.\n\nIt is important to note that while Tagawa Matsu's story is based on historical events, many details have been embellished or altered over time, making it difficult to separate fact from fiction. Nonetheless, her tale remains a powerful symbol of loyalty, love, and sacrifice in Japanese culture.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
