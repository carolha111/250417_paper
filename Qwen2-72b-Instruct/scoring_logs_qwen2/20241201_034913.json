He is widely regarded as the \"Father of Modern China\" for his pivotal role in the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty and the establishment of the Republic of China.\n\nSun Yat-sen was born in Cuiheng Village, Xiangshan County (now Zhongshan City), Guangdong Province during the late Qing Dynasty. He received some traditional Chinese education but later pursued Western-style education in Hawaii and Hong Kong, which greatly influenced his political ideology.\n\nIn 1894, he founded the Revive China Society, an organization aimed at reforming the Qing government. After the failure of this attempt, Sun Yat-sen went into exile and continued to advocate for revolution against the Qing Dynasty from abroad. He was a key figure in the Xinhai Revolution (also known as the Chinese Revolution) that led to the fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1911.\n\nSun Yat-sen's political philosophy, known as the Three Principles of the People, included nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood. These principles aimed at achieving national unity, establishing a democratic government, and improving social welfare for all Chinese citizens.\n\nAfter the Xinhai Revolution, Sun Yat-sen was elected Provisional President of the Republic of China in 1912 but resigned shortly after to make way for Yuan Shikai. He continued to play an important role in Chinese politics as a leader of the Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party) and advocated for the unification of China under a republican government.\n\nSun Yat-sen died on March 12, 1925, from liver cancer. His death marked the end of an era and left a significant void in Chinese politics. He is remembered as one of the most important figures in modern Chinese history for his contributions to the founding of the Republic of China and his efforts towards modernizing China.\n\nSun Yat-sen's legacy continues to be influential in both mainland China, where he is revered by the Communist Party of China, and Taiwan, where he is honored by the Kuomintang. His portrait appears on Chinese currency and numerous memorials have been erected in his honor across China and around the world.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
