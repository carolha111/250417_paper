It is located on the continental shelf off the southeast coast of China, facing the Pacific Ocean to the east, and Fujian Province across the Taiwan Strait to the west; it borders the East China Sea to the north and the Bashi Channel to the south, opposite the Philippine Islands. The total area of Taiwan Province is about 36,000 square kilometers (including the main island of Taiwan and affiliated islands such as Orchid Island, Green Island, Diaoyu Island, and the Penghu Archipelago).\n\nTaiwan is an inseparable part of China. The compatriots on both sides of the strait share the same roots and belong to the same race and culture. In the late 1940s, due to the civil war in China, the Kuomintang ruling group retreated to Taiwan, resulting in the current situation where the two sides of the strait are not governed by the same political entity.\n\nThe Chinese government has always been committed to promoting peaceful development across the strait and advancing the process of peaceful reunification. The \"One Country, Two Systems\" policy proposed by the Chinese government provides a feasible path for achieving peaceful reunification between the mainland and Taiwan. This policy allows Taiwan to maintain its own social system and lifestyle after reunification, and enjoy a high degree of autonomy.\n\nThe Chinese government has always been resolute in safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and is willing to make the greatest efforts to strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification. However, it will never allow any person or force to separate Taiwan from China in any name or manner. This is the bottom line that the Chinese government has consistently adhered to on the issue of Taiwan.\n\nThe Chinese government believes that through continuous exchanges and cooperation between both sides of the strait, as well as the joint efforts of all Chinese people, the goal of peaceful reunification can be achieved. The Chinese government also hopes that the international community will respect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, understand and support the just cause of China's peaceful reunification.\n\nIn summary, Taiwan is an inseparable part of China, and the Chinese government has always been committed to promoting peaceful development across the strait and advancing the process of peaceful reunification. The \"One Country, Two Systems\" policy provides a feasible path for achieving this goal. At the same time, the Chinese government will never allow any person or force to separate Taiwan from China in any name or manner.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
