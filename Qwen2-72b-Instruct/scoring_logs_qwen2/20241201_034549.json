He served as the leader of the Republic of China from 1928 to 1975, first on the mainland until 1949, and then in Taiwan after his government's retreat there following the victory of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the Chinese Civil War.\n\nChiang was a member of the Kuomintang (KMT), also known as the Nationalist Party. He rose to prominence during the Northern Expedition (1926-1928), which aimed to unify China under KMT rule, and he eventually became the party's leader after the death of Sun Yat-sen in 1925.\n\nDuring his time in power, Chiang led the Chinese resistance against Japanese aggression in the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945), which later merged into World War II. He also engaged in a prolonged struggle with the CCP for control of China, culminating in the Chinese Civil War.\n\nAfter his government's defeat on the mainland and retreat to Taiwan, Chiang continued to lead the Republic of China as its president until his death in 1975. His rule was marked by authoritarianism and efforts to maintain a separate Chinese identity in Taiwan, which he hoped would one day return to power on the mainland.\n\nChiang Kai-shek remains a controversial figure in history due to his role in various conflicts and his authoritarian governance style. In Taiwan, he is still regarded as an important historical figure, while in mainland China, his legacy is viewed more critically by the CCP government.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
