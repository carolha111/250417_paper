This jade sculpture was created during the late Qing Dynasty (1644–1912) and it's a stunning example of Chinese jade carving.\n\nThe piece measures about 18 cm tall by 10 cm wide and is made from two different types of jadeite: green for the leaves, and white for the head of the cabbage. The sculpture depicts a realistic-looking cabbage with a grasshopper perched on one leaf and a mantis crawling up another.\n\nThe significance of this piece lies in its intricate detail and symbolism. In Chinese culture, cabbages are often associated with wealth because they resemble ingots (ancient Chinese currency). The insects represent life and vitality. The green color of the jadeite is also considered auspicious as it symbolizes growth and prosperity.\n\nThis sculpture was originally part of the imperial collection in Beijing's Forbidden City before being moved to Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War. It has since become one of the most popular attractions at the National Palace Museum, drawing millions of visitors each year who marvel at its beauty and craftsmanship.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
