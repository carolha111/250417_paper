He served as the leader of the Republic of China both on mainland China before 1949 and later in Taiwan until his death.\n\nChiang Kai-shek rose to prominence within the Kuomintang (KMT), also known as the Chinese Nationalist Party, which was founded by Sun Yat-sen. After Sun's death in 1925, Chiang took control of the KMT and became a key figure in the Northern Expedition, a military campaign aimed at unifying China under KMT rule.\n\nDuring his leadership, Chiang Kai-shek faced numerous challenges, including the Japanese invasion during World War II, internal conflicts with warlords, and the Chinese Civil War against the Communist Party led by Mao Zedong. Despite receiving significant support from Western powers, particularly the United States, Chiang's forces were eventually defeated by the Communists in 1949.\n\nFollowing his defeat on the mainland, Chiang Kai-shek retreated to Taiwan with remnants of his government and military. He continued to lead the Republic of China (ROC) based in Taipei, maintaining a claim over all of China until his death in 1975. His rule was characterized by authoritarianism and efforts to resist communist influence.\n\nChiang's legacy is complex and often viewed differently within different regions and communities. In Taiwan, he is remembered for his role in resisting communism and modernizing the island, while on mainland China, his memory is more controversial due to his actions during the civil war and his opposition to the Communist Party.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
