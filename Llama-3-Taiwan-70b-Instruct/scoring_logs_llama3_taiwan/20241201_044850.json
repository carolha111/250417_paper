He joined the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang or KMT) in his early years and quickly rose through its ranks due to his military skills and leadership abilities. In 1924, he became the head of the Whampoa Military Academy, which trained many future leaders of the Nationalist forces.\n\nIn 1926, Chiang Kai-shek was appointed as the commander-in-chief of the National Revolutionary Army, leading the Northern Expedition to unify China under the Kuomintang's rule. He succeeded in defeating various warlords and established a centralized government with its capital in Nanjing in 1928.\n\nChiang Kai-shek became the chairman of the Nationalist Government in 1928 and continued to serve as the leader of the ROC throughout the following decades, except for a brief period from 1949 to 1950 when he temporarily stepped down. During his tenure, Chiang faced numerous challenges, including internal strife within the Kuomintang, Japanese aggression during World War II, and the rise of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) led by Mao Zedong.\n\nIn 1949, after years of conflict between the Nationalists and Communists in the Chinese Civil War, the CCP emerged victorious, establishing the People's Republic of China (PRC) on mainland China. Chiang Kai-shek and his followers retreated to Taiwan, where they continued to govern as the ROC government.\n\nChiang remained committed to eventually retaking mainland China from the Communists but was unsuccessful in achieving this goal during his lifetime. He implemented a series of reforms and modernization efforts in Taiwan, laying the foundation for its economic growth and development.\n\nChiang Kai-shek passed away on April 5, 1975, in Taipei, Taiwan. His legacy remains complex and contentious, with some viewing him as a strong leader who fought against Japanese aggression and worked to modernize China, while others criticize his authoritarian rule and human rights abuses during his tenure.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
