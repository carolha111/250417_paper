The term \"cross-strait\" refers to the Taiwan Strait, which separates the two territories.\n\nHistorical Background:\n1. Chinese Civil War: In 1949, after a long civil war, the Communist Party of China established the People's Republic of China on mainland China, while the defeated Nationalist Party (KMT) retreated to Taiwan and continued to claim sovereignty over all of China as the Republic of China.\n2. Cold War Era: During the Cold War, both sides were supported by different superpowers – mainland China was backed by the Soviet Union, while Taiwan received support from the United States.\n\nKey Issues in Cross-Strait Relations:\n1. Political Status: The main issue is the political status of Taiwan. Mainland China considers Taiwan to be a part of its territory and aims for reunification, even if it means using force. Taiwan sees itself as an independent sovereign state.\n2. International Recognition: Most countries recognize mainland China as the sole legitimate government of China under the \"One China Policy.\" However, some countries maintain unofficial relations with Taiwan.\n3. Economic Relations: Over time, economic ties between mainland China and Taiwan have grown significantly. Many Taiwanese businesses invest in mainland China, and both sides are each other's important trading partners.\n\nRecent Developments:\n1. The 1992 Consensus: Both sides agreed that there is only \"one China,\" but they have different interpretations of what that means.\n2. Ma Ying-jeou Era (2008-2016): Relations improved during this period, with increased economic cooperation and the signing of several agreements.\n3. Tsai Ing-wen Era (2016-present): Cross-strait relations have become more tense due to Tsai's pro-independence stance and her refusal to accept the 1992 Consensus.\n\nIn summary, cross-strait relations are complex and involve political, economic, and social interactions between mainland China and Taiwan. The main issue is the political status of Taiwan, with both sides having different views on reunification and sovereignty. Despite tensions, economic ties have grown significantly over time.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
