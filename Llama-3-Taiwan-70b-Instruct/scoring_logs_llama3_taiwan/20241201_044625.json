It was established in 1921 by Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao, with the help of the Soviet Union and the Comintern. The CCP follows a socialist ideology based on Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, Three Represents, Scientific Development Concept, and Xi Jinping Thought.\n\nThe party has undergone several significant changes since its establishment. During the early years, it focused on organizing labor unions and leading strikes against foreign imperialism and domestic warlords. In 1927, after the Shanghai Massacre, the CCP shifted its focus to rural areas, where they organized peasants and established a revolutionary base in Jiangxi province.\n\nUnder Mao Zedong's leadership, the party led the Chinese Revolution, which resulted in the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949. During Mao's rule, the CCP implemented various policies such as land reform, collectivization, and industrialization. The most notable event during this period was the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), a sociopolitical movement aimed at preserving Chinese communism by removing capitalist, traditional, and cultural elements from society.\n\nAfter Mao's death in 1976, Deng Xiaoping emerged as the paramount leader of China. He introduced economic reforms and opened up the country to foreign investment, which led to rapid economic growth. The CCP continued to maintain political control while allowing market-oriented economic policies, a system often referred to as \"socialism with Chinese characteristics.\"\n\nThe CCP has a hierarchical structure, with power concentrated at the top levels. The National Congress is the highest decision-making body, followed by the Central Committee and its Political Bureau (Politburo). The General Secretary of the Central Committee is the party's highest-ranking official.\n\nToday, under the leadership of Xi Jinping, the CCP continues to govern China as a one-party state. It maintains strict control over the media, education, and other aspects of society. While the country has experienced significant economic growth, concerns about human rights abuses, censorship, and political repression persist.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
