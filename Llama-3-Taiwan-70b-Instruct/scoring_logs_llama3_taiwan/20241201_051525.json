However, the People's Republic of China (PRC) claims Taiwan as part of its territory and views it as a breakaway province that must eventually be reunited with the mainland.\n\nThe relationship between China and Taiwan has been tense for decades, dating back to the Chinese civil war in 1949 when the defeated Nationalist forces fled to Taiwan. Since then, both sides have claimed to be the legitimate government of all of China, but neither side has been able to assert control over the other.\n\nIn recent years, China has increased its military presence near Taiwan and has become more aggressive in its rhetoric towards the island. This has led to concerns about a potential conflict between China and Taiwan, which could have serious implications for regional stability and global security.\n\nThe United States has long maintained a policy of strategic ambiguity towards Taiwan, meaning that it does not explicitly commit to defending the island but also does not rule out the possibility of doing so. This policy is intended to deter China from attempting to take control of Taiwan by force while also avoiding provoking Beijing unnecessarily.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between China and Taiwan is complex and fraught with tension. While both sides claim to represent all of China, they have been separated for decades and show no signs of reunifying in the near future. The risk of conflict between them remains a concern for the international community.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
