The People's Republic of China (PRC) considers Taiwan to be a part of its territory and has repeatedly stated that it will not hesitate to use force if necessary to prevent Taiwan from declaring independence.\n\nThe PRC claims sovereignty over Taiwan under the \"One China\" principle, which asserts that there is only one Chinese government and that Taiwan is a province of China. However, Taiwan sees itself as an independent country with its own democratically elected government and has developed its own distinct identity separate from mainland China.\n\nDespite this tension, economic ties between China and Taiwan have grown significantly in recent years, with many Taiwanese companies investing heavily in the mainland. There are also frequent exchanges between the two sides in areas such as tourism, education, and culture.\n\nHowever, political relations remain strained, with the PRC continuing to pressure other countries not to recognize Taiwan's independence and opposing any moves towards formal recognition of Taiwan by international organizations. The United States has maintained a policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" towards Taiwan, selling arms to the island for self-defense but stopping short of formally recognizing its independence.\n\nIn summary, China and Taiwan have a complex relationship marked by political tension and economic interdependence. While there is no immediate prospect of reunification or formal recognition of Taiwanese independence, both sides continue to navigate this delicate balance in their interactions with each other and the wider international community.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
