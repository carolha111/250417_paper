The term \"cross-strait\" refers to the Taiwan Strait, which separates the two territories.\n\nHistorically, both mainland China and Taiwan were part of a single Chinese state. However, after the Chinese Civil War in 1949, the defeated Nationalist government led by Chiang Kai-shek retreated to Taiwan, while the Communist Party established the People's Republic of China on the mainland. Since then, the two sides have been politically divided.\n\nThe relationship between mainland China and Taiwan has experienced various stages:\n\n1. Confrontation (1949-1970s): During this period, both sides claimed to be the legitimate government of all China and refused to recognize each other's existence. Military threats and conflicts were common.\n2. Rapprochement (1980s-1990s): With the death of Chiang Kai-shek in 1975 and changes in leadership on both sides, there was a gradual easing of tensions. In 1991, Taiwan established the Mainland Affairs Council, while mainland China set up the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office to manage cross-strait affairs.\n3. Increased engagement (2000s): The election of Chen Shui-bian as Taiwan's president in 2000 brought some uncertainty, but his successor Ma Ying-jeou improved relations with mainland China by promoting economic and cultural exchanges.\n4. Current situation: Since the election of Tsai Ing-wen as Taiwan's president in 2016, cross-strait relations have become more strained due to her pro-independence stance. Mainland China has increased military pressure on Taiwan and limited official communication channels.\n\nThe future of Cross-Strait relations remains uncertain, with potential outcomes ranging from peaceful reunification to continued political separation or even conflict. The international community, particularly the United States, plays a significant role in shaping the dynamics between mainland China and Taiwan.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
