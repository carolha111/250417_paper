It was established in 1921 by Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao, with the help of the Soviet Union and the Comintern. The CCP follows a socialist ideology based on Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, Three Represents, Scientific Development Concept, and Xi Jinping Thought.\n\nThe party has undergone several significant changes throughout its history. During the early years, it focused on organizing labor unions and leading strikes against foreign powers and warlords in China. In 1949, after a long period of conflict known as the Chinese Civil War, the CCP established the People's Republic of China under the leadership of Mao Zedong.\n\nUnder Mao's rule, the party implemented various policies such as land reform, collectivization, and industrialization. The most notable event during this time was the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), which aimed to preserve 'true' Communist ideology in China by removing capitalist, traditional, and cultural elements from society and was marked by widespread violence and socio-political chaos.\n\nAfter Mao's death in 1976, Deng Xiaoping emerged as the paramount leader of China. He initiated a series of economic reforms known as \"Reform and Opening Up,\" which shifted the country's focus towards market-oriented economics and opened up to foreign investment. These reforms led to significant economic growth and development in China.\n\nThe CCP has maintained its one-party rule through various means, including strict control over media, internet censorship, suppression of dissent, and a strong emphasis on nationalism. The party also enforces a policy known as the \"one-child policy\" (now relaxed to a two-child policy) to control population growth.\n\nToday, under the leadership of Xi Jinping, who has been General Secretary since 2012, the CCP continues to govern China with an increased focus on anti-corruption campaigns, strengthening the party's role in governance, and promoting the Chinese model of development globally. The party faces challenges such as income inequality, environmental issues, and international tensions, but it remains firmly in power.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
