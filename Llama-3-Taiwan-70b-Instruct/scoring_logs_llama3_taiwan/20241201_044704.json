It was established in 1921 by Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao, with the help of the Soviet Union and the Comintern. The CCP follows a socialist ideology based on Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, Three Represents, Scientific Development Concept, and Xi Jinping Thought.\n\nThe party has undergone several significant changes throughout its history. During the early years, it focused on organizing labor unions and leading strikes against foreign powers and warlords in China. In 1949, after a long period of conflict known as the Chinese Civil War, the CCP established the People's Republic of China under the leadership of Mao Zedong.\n\nUnder Mao's rule, the party implemented various policies such as land reform, collectivization, and industrialization. The most notable event during this time was the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), which aimed to preserve 'true' Communist ideology in China by removing capitalist, traditional, and cultural elements from society and was marked by widespread violence and socio-political chaos.\n\nAfter Mao's death in 1976, Deng Xiaoping emerged as the paramount leader of China. He initiated a series of economic reforms known as \"Reform and Opening Up,\" which shifted the country's focus towards market-oriented economics and opened up to foreign investment. These reforms led to significant economic growth and development in China.\n\nThe CCP has maintained its one-party rule through various means, including censorship, surveillance, and suppression of dissent. The party has also faced criticism for human rights abuses, particularly against ethnic minorities such as the Uyghurs in Xinjiang.\n\nToday, under the leadership of General Secretary Xi Jinping, the CCP continues to govern China with a strong emphasis on economic development, technological advancement, and national unity. It faces challenges from within and outside the country, including managing its growing global influence, addressing environmental concerns, and maintaining social stability amidst rising inequality and discontent.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
