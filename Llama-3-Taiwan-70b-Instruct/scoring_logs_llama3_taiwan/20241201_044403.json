It was founded by Sun Yat-sen in 1912 and played a significant role in China's history throughout the 20th century.\n\n1. Origins: The KMT emerged from the merger of several revolutionary groups that sought to overthrow the Qing Dynasty and establish a republic in China. Sun Yat-sen, considered the father of modern China, was elected as the first provisional president of the Republic of China (ROC) after the fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1912.\n\n2. Early years: The KMT initially struggled for power with regional warlords and other political factions. In 1924, under the leadership of Sun Yat-sen's successor Chiang Kai-shek, the party established a military government in Guangzhou (Canton) to reunify China.\n\n3. Northern Expedition and Nanjing Decade: The KMT launched the Northern Expedition in 1926 to defeat regional warlords and unify China. By 1928, they had succeeded in establishing control over most of China, with their capital in Nanjing. This period, known as the Nanjing Decade (1927-1937), saw efforts to modernize China's economy, education, and infrastructure.\n\n4. Chinese Civil War: The KMT faced opposition from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) throughout its rule. After Japan invaded Manchuria in 1931, both parties formed a united front against Japanese aggression during World War II. However, after Japan's defeat in 1945, civil war broke out between the KMT and CCP.\n\n5. Retreat to Taiwan: The KMT was defeated by the CCP in the Chinese Civil War and retreated to Taiwan in 1949, establishing their government there under Chiang Kai-shek's leadership. They continued to claim sovereignty over all of China, including mainland China, which was now governed by the People's Republic of China (PRC).\n\n6. Rule in Taiwan: The KMT ruled Taiwan as a one-party state for several decades, implementing land reforms and promoting economic development. In 1949, they declared martial law, which lasted until 1987. During this time, political opposition was suppressed, and the party maintained strict control over the island.\n\n7. Democratization: In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Taiwan underwent a process of democratization under President Chiang Ching-kuo (Chiang Kai-shek's son) and his successor Lee Teng-hui. The KMT began to face competition from opposition parties, particularly the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).\n\n8. Present day: Today, the KMT remains one of Taiwan's major political parties, advocating for closer ties with mainland China and promoting a Chinese identity. It has experienced periods of both majority and minority rule in Taiwan's government, alternating power with the DPP.\n\nIn summary, the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) played a significant role in shaping modern Chinese history, from its founding by Sun Yat-sen to its current status as one of Taiwan's major political parties.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
