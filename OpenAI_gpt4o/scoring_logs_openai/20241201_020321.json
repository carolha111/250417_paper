She is widely worshipped by fishermen, sailors, and those whose livelihoods are connected to the sea, as she is believed to provide protection, guidance, and blessings for safe voyages.\n\n### Origins and Mythology\nMazu's origins trace back to a historical figure named Lin Mo (林默), who is said to have lived during the Song Dynasty (960–1279 CE) in Fujian Province, China. According to legend, Lin Mo was born in 960 CE on Meizhou Island. She was known for her intelligence, piety, and compassion from a young age. She was said to have had extraordinary abilities, including the power to predict weather changes and save people from shipwrecks.\n\nOne of the most famous legends about her involves her miraculous rescue of her family members during a storm at sea. In the story, she fell into a trance and used her spiritual powers to guide their boat to safety. After her death at the age of 27 (or 28, depending on the version), she was venerated as a deity because of her acts of kindness and her connection to the sea.\n\n### Titles and Honors\nOver the centuries, Mazu has been granted numerous titles by Chinese emperors, reflecting her growing importance in Chinese culture. She is often referred to as the \"Queen of Heaven\" (天后, Tiānhòu) or \"Holy Mother\" (聖母, Shèngmǔ). Her worship spread beyond China to other parts of Asia, including Taiwan, Vietnam, and Malaysia, as Chinese communities migrated.\n\n### Worship and Temples\nMazu is one of the most widely worshipped deities in Chinese folk religion. Her temples, known as Mazu Temples (媽祖廟, Māzǔ Miào), are found throughout coastal regions of China, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia. The most famous temple dedicated to her is the Meizhou Mazu Temple in Fujian Province, which is considered her birthplace and a major pilgrimage site.\n\nDevotees often pray to Mazu for protection, especially before embarking on sea journeys. Offerings such as incense, food, and paper money are made at her altars. Festivals in her honor, such as her birthday (on the 23rd day of the third lunar month), are celebrated with grand processions, dragon dances, and other traditional activities.\n\n### Symbolism and Legacy\nMazu symbolizes protection, compassion, and the enduring connection between humanity and the natural world. Her worship reflects the importance of the sea in the lives of coastal communities and the human desire for safety and guidance in the face of nature's unpredictability.\n\nToday, Mazu remains a unifying cultural figure for Chinese communities worldwide, and her worship continues to thrive as a testament to her enduring legacy.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
