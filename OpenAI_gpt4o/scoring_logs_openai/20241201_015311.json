However, his son, Zheng Chenggong, refused to submit to the Qing and continued to fight against them, leading a resistance movement based in Taiwan.\n\nZheng Zhilong's decision to surrender ultimately led to his downfall. The Qing distrusted him and saw him as a potential threat due to his son's rebellion. In 1661, Zheng Zhilong was executed by the Qing government.\n\nZheng Zhilong's legacy is complex.
