It played a central role in the political and military history of modern China and Taiwan. Below is an overview of the party's history, ideology, and significance:\n\n---\n\n### **Founding and Early History**\n- The Kuomintang (KMT) was founded in **1912** by **Sun Yat-sen**, a revolutionary leader who is often referred to as the \"Father of Modern China.\" The party was established after the fall of the Qing Dynasty and the founding of the Republic of China (ROC).\n- The KMT was initially a revolutionary party that sought to modernize China and establish a democratic republic based on Sun Yat-sen's \"Three Principles of the People\":\n  1. **Nationalism**: Advocating for Chinese independence and unity, free from foreign domination.\n  2. **Democracy**: Promoting a government accountable to the people.\n  3. **People's Livelihood**: Advocating for social welfare and economic reforms.\n\n---\n\n### **Rise to Power**\n- In the 1920s, the KMT allied with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to fight against warlords and unify China during the **Northern Expedition** (1926–1928). However, this alliance broke down in 1927 when KMT leader **Chiang Kai-shek** purged communists from the party and launched a civil war against the CCP.\n- The KMT established the **Republic of China (ROC)** government in **Nanjing** in 1928, with Chiang Kai-shek as its leader. The party ruled China as a one-party state during this period, focusing on modernization and resisting Japanese aggression.\n\n---\n\n### **World War II and the Chinese Civil War**\n- During **World War II**, the KMT led China's resistance against the Japanese invasion (1937–1945). However, the war weakened the KMT's control over China.\n- After Japan's defeat, the KMT resumed its civil war with the CCP. The communists, led by **Mao Zedong**, ultimately defeated the KMT in 1949, forcing Chiang Kai-shek and the KMT government to retreat to the island of **Taiwan**.\n\n---\n\n### **The KMT in Taiwan**\n- After retreating to Taiwan, the KMT established a government-in-exile, continuing to claim sovereignty over all of China. Taiwan was placed under martial law, and the KMT ruled as a one-party state for decades.\n- Under KMT rule, Taiwan experienced rapid economic growth and modernization, often referred to as the \"Taiwan Miracle.\" However, the party was criticized for authoritarianism and suppressing political dissent, including the **228 Incident** (1947) and the **White Terror** period.\n- In the late 20th century, the KMT began to democratize under leaders like **Chiang Ching-kuo** and **Lee Teng-hui**, lifting martial law in 1987 and allowing for free elections.\n\n---\n\n### **Modern Role in Taiwanese Politics**\n- Today, the KMT is one of Taiwan's two major political parties, alongside the **Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)**. The KMT generally supports:\n  - Closer economic and political ties with mainland China.\n  - Maintaining the \"status quo\" in cross-strait relations (neither declaring independence nor pursuing unification in the short term).\n  - A more conservative approach to Taiwanese identity, emphasizing the historical connection to China.\n- The DPP, in contrast, tends to advocate for a stronger Taiwanese identity and is more skeptical of ties with China.\n\n---\n\n### **Challenges and Decline**\n- In recent years, the KMT has faced challenges, including declining public support, especially among younger Taiwanese who identify more strongly with a distinct Taiwanese identity rather than a Chinese one.\n- The party has also struggled to balance its traditional pro-China stance with growing concerns in Taiwan about Beijing's increasing assertiveness and threats to Taiwan's democracy.\n\n---\n\n### **Significance**\nThe KMT has played a pivotal role in shaping the modern history of both China and Taiwan. While its influence has waned in recent years, it remains a key player in Taiwanese politics and a symbol of the complex relationship between Taiwan and mainland China.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
