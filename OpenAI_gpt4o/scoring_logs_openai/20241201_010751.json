It is a small, intricately carved piece of jasper that closely resembles a piece of braised pork belly, complete with layers of \"fat\" and \"meat.\" The stone is celebrated for its lifelike appearance and the skillful use of the natural colors and textures of the jasper to mimic the marbled layers of pork.\n\n### Key Features:\n1. **Material**: The Meat-shaped Stone is made from jasper, a type of quartz. The natural reddish-brown and creamy white hues of the stone were carefully utilized to create the realistic appearance of cooked pork belly.\n   \n2. **Craftsmanship**: The stone was carved during the Qing dynasty (1644–1912), likely in the 18th century. The artisan skillfully enhanced the natural patterns of the jasper to create the illusion of layers of lean meat, fat, and skin, mimicking the texture and appearance of braised pork belly, a popular dish in Chinese cuisine.\n\n3. **Size**: The Meat-shaped Stone is relatively small, measuring only about 5.73 cm (2.25 inches) in height, but its intricate detail and realism make it a standout piece.\n\n4. **Cultural Significance**: The Meat-shaped Stone is a prime example of **\"gongshi\"** (scholars' rocks) and **\"qishi\"** (curious stones), which were highly valued in Chinese culture for their natural beauty and resemblance to objects or scenes. It also reflects the Qing dynasty's fascination with trompe-l'œil (optical illusion) and the blending of art and nature.\n\n5. **Location**: The Meat-shaped Stone is part of the collection at the **National Palace Museum** in Taipei, Taiwan. It is one of the museum's most popular and iconic artifacts, often displayed alongside other famous works like the **Jadeite Cabbage**.\n\n### Symbolism:\nThe Meat-shaped Stone is more than just a whimsical piece of art. In Chinese culture, food often carries symbolic meanings, and pork belly, in particular, is associated with prosperity and abundance. The stone may have been created as a playful yet meaningful representation of these values.\n\n### Popularity:\nThe Meat-shaped Stone has become a cultural icon and a favorite among visitors to the National Palace Museum. Its lifelike appearance and the ingenuity of its creation continue to fascinate art enthusiasts and casual viewers alike, making it a symbol of the extraordinary skill of Qing dynasty artisans.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
