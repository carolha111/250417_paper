It is a small, intricately carved piece of jasper that resembles a piece of braised pork belly, complete with layers of \"fat\" and \"meat.\" This stone is celebrated for its lifelike appearance and is considered a masterpiece of trompe-l'œil (a technique that creates the optical illusion of three-dimensionality).\n\n### Key Features:\n1. **Material**: The Meat-shaped Stone is made of jasper, a type of quartz. The natural colors and patterns of the stone were skillfully utilized by the artist to mimic the appearance of pork belly.\n   \n2. **Appearance**: The stone is carved and polished to resemble a piece of braised pork belly, a popular dish in Chinese cuisine. The layers of the stone are used to depict the fatty and lean parts of the meat, while the surface is textured to imitate the skin.\n\n3. **Size**: The Meat-shaped Stone is relatively small, measuring about 5.73 cm (2.25 inches) in height, making its intricate detail even more impressive.\n\n4. **Cultural Significance**: The Meat-shaped Stone is a prime example of the Chinese appreciation for craftsmanship, natural materials, and the blending of art with everyday life. It also reflects the importance of food in Chinese culture, as well as the tradition of creating art that mimics nature.\n\n5. **Historical Context**: The stone is believed to have been created during the **Qing Dynasty** (1644–1912), a period known for its flourishing arts and crafts. It was likely made as a decorative object for the imperial court.\n\n6. **Current Location**: The Meat-shaped Stone is housed in the **National Palace Museum** in Taipei, Taiwan, where it is one of the most popular and iconic exhibits. It is often displayed alongside other famous works, such as the **Jadeite Cabbage**, another masterpiece of Chinese art.\n\n### Symbolism:\nThe Meat-shaped Stone is more than just a realistic carving; it also carries symbolic meaning. In Chinese culture, food is often associated with prosperity, abundance, and familial harmony. The stone's resemblance to a beloved dish may evoke feelings of comfort and nostalgia, while its craftsmanship demonstrates the skill and ingenuity of the artist.\n\nIn summary, the Meat-shaped Stone is a small but extraordinary work of art that exemplifies the ingenuity of Chinese artisans and the cultural significance of food in Chinese society. Its lifelike appearance continues to captivate viewers and make it a treasured artifact in the National Palace Museum.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
