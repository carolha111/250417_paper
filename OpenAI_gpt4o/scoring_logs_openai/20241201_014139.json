He is often referred to as the \"Father of Modern China\" for his pivotal role in shaping the country's transition from monarchy to a republic. Sun is celebrated in both mainland China and Taiwan, though his legacy is interpreted differently in each.\n\n### Early Life and Education\nSun was born on November 12, 1866, in Guangdong Province, China. He grew up in a rural farming family but later moved to Hawaii, where he received a Western-style education. His exposure to Western ideas, including democracy, republicanism, and Christianity, deeply influenced his political philosophy and vision for China's future.\n\n### Revolutionary Activities\nSun Yat-sen became increasingly critical of the Qing Dynasty, which he viewed as corrupt and incapable of modernizing China. He began organizing revolutionary movements to overthrow the monarchy and establish a republic. In 1894, he founded the **Revive China Society** (Xingzhonghui), which aimed to promote reform and revolution.\n\nIn 1905, Sun helped establish the **Tongmenghui** (United League), a revolutionary alliance that sought to unite anti-Qing forces. He also developed his political philosophy, known as the **Three Principles of the People**:\n1. **Nationalism**: Advocating for Chinese independence and the end of foreign domination.\n2. **Democracy**: Promoting a republican form of government with political rights for the people.\n3. **People's Livelihood**: Addressing social and economic inequalities, including land reform and wealth redistribution.\n\n### The 1911 Revolution and the Republic of China\nSun's efforts culminated in the **1911 Revolution**, which led to the fall of the Qing Dynasty. On January 1, 1912, Sun was elected the **provisional president of the Republic of China**, marking the establishment of the first republic in Chinese history. However, he soon stepped down in favor of Yuan Shikai, a powerful military leader, in hopes of unifying the country. This decision ultimately led to political fragmentation and conflict.\n\n### Later Years and Legacy\nSun continued to work toward unifying China and promoting his vision of a modern, democratic nation. In 1919, he reorganized his political party, the **Kuomintang (KMT)** or Nationalist Party, which became a major force in Chinese politics. He also sought Soviet support and cooperation with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to achieve national unity.\n\nSun Yat-sen died of liver cancer on March 12, 1925, before he could see his vision fully realized. His death left a power vacuum that eventually led to a civil war between the KMT and the CCP.\n\n### Legacy\nSun Yat-sen is revered as a unifying figure in Chinese history. In mainland China, he is honored as a revolutionary pioneer, while in Taiwan, he is celebrated as the founder of the Republic of China. His ideas and principles continue to influence Chinese political thought and are seen as a bridge between traditional and modern China.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
