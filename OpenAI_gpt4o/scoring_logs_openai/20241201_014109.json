He played a pivotal role in overthrowing the Qing Dynasty, which had ruled China for over 250 years, and is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in modern Chinese history. Sun is often referred to as the \"Father of the Nation\" in both the People's Republic of China (mainland China) and the Republic of China (Taiwan), though his legacy is interpreted differently in each.\n\n### Early Life and Education\nSun was born on November 12, 1866, in a small village in Guangdong Province, China. He grew up in a rural farming family but later moved to Hawaii, where he received a Western-style education. He also studied medicine in Hong Kong and became a qualified doctor. However, he soon abandoned his medical career to focus on political reform, as he became increasingly disillusioned with the corruption and inefficiency of the Qing government.\n\n### Revolutionary Activities\nSun Yat-sen was a key figure in the movement to modernize China and replace the imperial system with a republic. He founded several revolutionary organizations, including the **Revive China Society** and the **Tongmenghui (United League)**, which sought to unite anti-Qing forces. Sun traveled extensively, raising funds and support for his cause among overseas Chinese communities and foreign governments.\n\nIn 1911, the **Xinhai Revolution** successfully overthrew the Qing Dynasty, ending over 2,000 years of imperial rule in China. Sun was elected as the **provisional president** of the newly established Republic of China in 1912. However, he soon stepped down in favor of Yuan Shikai, a powerful military leader, in the hope of unifying the country. This decision ultimately led to political fragmentation and conflict.\n\n### Three Principles of the People\nSun Yat-sen is best known for his political philosophy, the **Three Principles of the People**:\n1. **Nationalism**: Advocating for Chinese independence and unity, free from foreign domination.\n2. **Democracy**: Promoting a government that represents the people and includes constitutional rule.\n3. **People's Livelihood**: Addressing social and economic issues, including land reform and wealth redistribution, to improve the lives of ordinary citizens.\n\nThese principles became the ideological foundation of the **Kuomintang (KMT)**, or Nationalist Party, which Sun founded in 1919.\n\n### Later Life and Legacy\nSun Yat-sen spent much of his later life trying to unify China, which had become divided among warlords after the fall of the Qing Dynasty. He sought support from various groups, including the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communist Party, to strengthen the Nationalist movement. However, he died of liver cancer on March 12, 1925, before achieving his goal of a fully unified and modernized China.\n\nSun's legacy is complex and contested. In Taiwan, he is celebrated as the founder of the Republic of China, while in mainland China, he is honored as a revolutionary who helped pave the way for the eventual establishment of the People's Republic of China. Despite political differences, both sides recognize his contributions to China's modernization and his vision for a strong, independent nation.\n\nSun Yat-sen remains a symbol of Chinese nationalism, reform, and unity, and his ideas continue to influence Chinese politics and society.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
