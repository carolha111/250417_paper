He was the leader of the **Kuomintang (KMT)**, or the Nationalist Party of China, and served as the head of the Republic of China (ROC) from 1928 to 1949 on the Chinese mainland, and later in Taiwan until his death in 1975.\n\n### Early Life and Rise to Power\nChiang was born in Zhejiang Province and received military training in Japan. He became involved in revolutionary activities and joined the Kuomintang, which was founded by Sun Yat-sen, the leader of the 1911 revolution that overthrew the Qing Dynasty. After Sun's death in 1925, Chiang emerged as his successor and consolidated power within the KMT.\n\n### Leadership in China\nChiang led the **Northern Expedition** (1926–1928), a military campaign to unify China by defeating regional warlords. By 1928, he established the Nationalist government in Nanjing, marking the beginning of the \"Nanjing Decade,\" a period of relative stability and modernization in China. However, his government faced challenges, including widespread corruption, Japanese aggression, and the growing influence of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).\n\n### Conflict with the Communists and Japan\nChiang was a staunch anti-communist and led efforts to suppress the CCP during the Chinese Civil War. However, the outbreak of the **Second Sino-Japanese War** (1937–1945) forced the Nationalists and Communists into a temporary alliance to resist Japanese invasion. After Japan's defeat in World War II, the civil war resumed, and Chiang's forces were ultimately defeated by the Communists under Mao Zedong in 1949.\n\n### Exile to Taiwan\nAfter the Communist victory, Chiang and the Nationalist government retreated to the island of **Taiwan**, where he established a government-in-exile. He continued to claim sovereignty over all of China and ruled Taiwan under martial law. During his leadership in Taiwan, Chiang oversaw economic development and modernization, laying the groundwork for Taiwan's later transformation into a prosperous democracy.\n\n### Legacy\nChiang Kai-shek remains a controversial figure. Supporters credit him with resisting Japanese aggression, modernizing China, and preserving Chinese culture in Taiwan. Critics, however, point to his authoritarian rule, corruption within his government, and failure to effectively address social and economic issues on the mainland. His legacy is still debated in both Taiwan and mainland China today.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
