It is the dominant political force in China and operates as a single-party system, meaning it holds a monopoly on political power. The CCP was established in **1921** and has played a central role in shaping modern Chinese history, politics, and society.\n\n### Key Features of the CCP:\n\n1. **Founding and Early History**:\n   - The CCP was founded in **Shanghai in 1921** by a small group of intellectuals inspired by Marxist-Leninist ideology and the success of the Russian Revolution (1917).\n   - Early on, the CCP allied with the nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) to fight warlords and unify China. However, this alliance broke down, leading to a civil war between the CCP and the KMT.\n   - The CCP gained support among peasants and workers, particularly during the **Long March (1934–1935)** and the fight against Japanese occupation during World War II.\n\n2. **Rise to Power**:\n   - After defeating the KMT in the Chinese Civil War (1945–1949), the CCP established the People's Republic of China on **October 1, 1949**, under the leadership of **Mao Zedong**.\n   - The KMT retreated to Taiwan, where it established a separate government.\n\n3. **Ideology**:\n   - The CCP is rooted in **Marxism-Leninism**, which advocates for a classless, communist society through the leadership of a vanguard party.\n   - Over time, the CCP has adapted its ideology to include **Mao Zedong Thought**, **Deng Xiaoping Theory**, and more recently, **Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era**.\n   - While the CCP still claims to be a communist party, its policies have incorporated significant elements of market-oriented reforms and state capitalism since the late 1970s.\n\n4. **Structure and Organization**:\n   - The CCP is highly centralized and hierarchical, with power concentrated in the **Politburo Standing Committee**, the top decision-making body.\n   - The **General Secretary** is the highest-ranking official in the CCP. Since 2012, this position has been held by **Xi Jinping**.\n   - The CCP operates through a system of **democratic centralism**, where decisions are made collectively but must be followed strictly once finalized.\n   - The CCP has over **96 million members** (as of 2023), making it one of the largest political organizations in the world.\n\n5. **Role in Governance**:\n   - The CCP controls all aspects of the Chinese government, military, and society. The state apparatus, including the National People's Congress (NPC) and the State Council, functions under the leadership of the CCP.\n   - The **People's Liberation Army (PLA)** is also under the direct control of the CCP, not the state.\n\n6. **Major Historical Events**:\n   - **Great Leap Forward (1958–1962)**: A campaign to rapidly industrialize and collectivize agriculture, which led to widespread famine and millions of deaths.\n   - **Cultural Revolution (1966–1976)**: A period of political and social upheaval initiated by Mao Zedong to reinforce communist ideology, resulting in chaos, persecution, and economic disruption.\n   - **Economic Reforms (1978–present)**: Under **Deng Xiaoping**, the CCP shifted toward market-oriented reforms, opening China to foreign investment and trade while maintaining political control.\n   - **Tiananmen Square Protests (1989)**: Pro-democracy protests were violently suppressed by the CCP, highlighting its intolerance of political dissent.\n\n7. **Modern Era under Xi Jinping**:\n   - Since Xi Jinping became General Secretary in 2012, the CCP has emphasized **centralized authority**, **anti-corruption campaigns**, and a more assertive role for China on the global stage.\n   - Xi has consolidated power, abolished presidential term limits, and promoted his own ideology, **Xi Jinping Thought**, as a guiding principle for the CCP and the nation.\n   - The CCP has also increased its use of technology for surveillance and control, including the **social credit system** and internet censorship.\n\n8. **Global Influence**:\n   - The CCP has expanded China's global influence through initiatives like the **Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)**, which aims to build infrastructure and trade networks across Asia, Africa, and Europe.\n   - It has also sought to promote its governance model as an alternative to liberal democracy, emphasizing stability, economic growth, and state control.\n\n### Criticism and Controversies:\nThe CCP has faced significant criticism for its:\n   - **Human rights abuses**, including the treatment of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, suppression of dissent in Hong Kong, and censorship of political opposition.\n   - Lack of political freedoms and suppression of democracy.\n   - Tight control over media, internet, and civil society.\n   - Aggressive policies in the South China Sea and toward Taiwan.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe Chinese Communist Party is a highly influential and powerful organization that has shaped China's trajectory over the past century. While it has overseen significant economic growth and modernization, it remains controversial for its authoritarian governance, suppression of dissent, and human rights record. Its role in global politics continues to grow as China asserts itself as a major world power.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
