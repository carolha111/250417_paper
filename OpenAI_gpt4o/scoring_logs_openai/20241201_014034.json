He is often referred to as the \"Father of Modern China\" for his pivotal role in shaping the country's transition from a monarchy to a republic. Sun is celebrated in both mainland China and Taiwan, though his legacy is interpreted differently in each.\n\n### Early Life and Education\nSun was born on November 12, 1866, in Guangdong Province, China, into a peasant family. He received a traditional Chinese education but later studied in Hawaii and Hong Kong, where he was exposed to Western ideas, including democracy, science, and Christianity. These influences shaped his vision for a modern, progressive China.\n\n### Revolutionary Activities\nSun Yat-sen became increasingly critical of the Qing Dynasty, which he viewed as corrupt and incapable of modernizing China. In 1894, he founded the *Revive China Society* (興中會), an organization dedicated to overthrowing the Qing government. Over the years, he organized and participated in several failed uprisings, which forced him into exile in Japan, the United States, and Europe.\n\nIn 1905, Sun founded the *Tongmenghui* (United League), a revolutionary alliance that sought to unite anti-Qing forces. He also developed his political philosophy, known as the \"Three Principles of the People\" (*Sanmin Zhuyi*):\n1. **Nationalism**: Advocating for Chinese independence and the end of foreign domination.\n2. **Democracy**: Promoting a government based on the will of the people.\n3. **People's Livelihood**: Addressing social and economic inequalities.\n\n### Founding of the Republic of China\nSun's efforts culminated in the 1911 Xinhai Revolution, which led to the fall of the Qing Dynasty. On January 1, 1912, Sun was elected the provisional president of the newly established Republic of China. However, he soon stepped down in favor of Yuan Shikai, a powerful military leader, in hopes of unifying the country. This decision ultimately led to political fragmentation and conflict.\n\n### Later Years and Legacy\nSun continued to work toward unifying China and promoting his vision of a modern republic. In 1919, he reorganized his political movement into the *Kuomintang* (KMT, or Nationalist Party). He sought Soviet support and formed an alliance with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to combat warlordism and foreign imperialism.\n\nSun Yat-sen died of liver cancer on March 12, 1925, in Beijing. His death left a power vacuum, and his successors, including Chiang Kai-shek, struggled to achieve his vision of a unified and democratic China.\n\n### Legacy\nSun Yat-sen is revered as a national hero in both the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China (Taiwan). In mainland China, he is honored as a revolutionary pioneer, while in Taiwan, he is celebrated as the founder of the Republic of China. His ideas and leadership continue to inspire discussions about China's political and social development.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
