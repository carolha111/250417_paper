He was part of a network of maritime merchants and pirates who operated along the coasts of China, Japan, and Southeast Asia. Zheng Zhilong's success in maritime trade and piracy earned him significant wealth and influence.\n\nIn the 1620s, Zheng Zhilong was recruited by the Ming government to suppress piracy, a common practice at the time to co-opt powerful pirates into official service. He became a naval commander for the Ming dynasty and used his fleet to protect coastal areas and trade routes. His loyalty to the Ming court, however, was often questioned due to his opportunistic nature and personal ambitions.\n\nWhen the Qing dynasty began its conquest of China in the mid-17th century, Zheng Zhilong initially resisted but later surrendered to the Qing forces in 1646, hoping to secure a favorable position for himself and his family. However, his son Zheng Chenggong (Koxinga) refused to submit to the Qing and continued to fight against them, becoming a symbol of resistance.\n\nZheng Zhilong's decision to surrender ultimately led to his downfall. The Qing distrusted him and saw him as a potential threat due to his son's rebellion. In 1661, Zheng Zhilong was executed by the Qing government in Beijing.\n\nZheng Zhilong's legacy is complex. He was a skilled and ambitious leader who navigated the turbulent world of piracy, trade, and politics, but his shifting allegiances and ultimate surrender to the Qing tarnished his reputation. His son, Zheng Chenggong, overshadowed him in historical memory as a staunch defender of the Ming dynasty and a key figure in the history of Taiwan.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
