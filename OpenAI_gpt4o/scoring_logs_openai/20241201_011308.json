It is renowned not only for its craftsmanship but also for the exceptionally long inscription cast inside it, which provides valuable historical and cultural insights into the Zhou dynasty's political and social systems.\n\n### Description of the Vessel:\nThe Mao Gong Ding is a **ding**, a type of tripod cauldron with two loop handles, which was commonly used in ancient China for ritual purposes, such as offerings to ancestors or deities. The vessel is made of bronze and is relatively large, standing about 53.8 cm tall and weighing approximately 34.7 kg. Its design is typical of Zhou dynasty bronzes, featuring a simple yet elegant shape with minimal decorative patterns, emphasizing its solemn ritual function.\n\n### The Inscription:\nThe Mao Gong Ding is most famous for its **500-character inscription**, the longest known inscription on any Chinese bronze vessel. The text is written in early Chinese script (known as \"bronze script\") and is a critical source for understanding the history, governance, and culture of the Western Zhou period.\n\nThe inscription records a royal edict issued by a Zhou king (likely King Xuan of Zhou, who reigned from 827–782 BCE) to a high-ranking official named Mao Gong (毛公), after whom the vessel is named. In the edict, the king praises Mao Gong for his loyalty and service, entrusts him with important responsibilities, and outlines the moral and administrative principles he should follow. The text also reflects the Zhou dynasty's emphasis on the \"Mandate of Heaven\" (天命), the divine right to rule, and the importance of virtuous governance.\n\n### Historical and Cultural Significance:\n1. **Historical Record**: The inscription provides a rare and detailed glimpse into the political structure, administrative practices, and moral values of the Western Zhou dynasty. It highlights the relationship between the king and his officials, as well as the expectations of loyalty and good governance.\n\n2. **Linguistic Value**: The text is a key resource for studying early Chinese writing and the evolution of Chinese characters. It is an important example of the \"bronze script,\" a precursor to later forms of Chinese calligraphy.\n\n3. **Ritual and Symbolism**: The ding itself was a symbol of power and authority in ancient China. By commissioning this vessel, Mao Gong not only fulfilled his ritual duties but also commemorated the royal favor he received, ensuring his legacy for future generations.\n\n4. **Artistic Achievement**: The Mao Gong Ding exemplifies the high level of craftsmanship achieved during the Western Zhou period, both in terms of its casting technique and the precision of the inscription.\n\n### Current Location:\nThe Mao Gong Ding is now housed in the **National Palace Museum in Taipei**, Taiwan, where it is considered one of the most treasured artifacts in the museum's collection.\n\nIn summary, the Mao Gong Ding is a masterpiece of ancient Chinese bronze art and a vital historical document that sheds light on the political, cultural, and linguistic aspects of the Western Zhou dynasty. Its combination of artistic beauty and historical importance makes it one of the most celebrated artifacts of ancient China.\n                   \n                   ### 결과            \n                   \n                   ",
